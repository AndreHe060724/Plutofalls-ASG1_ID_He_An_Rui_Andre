# Shake & Sip – Web Design Project 

Hi! Welcome to my *Shake & Sip* website project!  
This site is made to look like a real café brand, and I built it using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
I wanted to make everything look clean, modern, and easy to browse — kinda like the kind of website I would actually enjoy using.

# Pages Included

# Home Page
The homepage introduces the brand with a big hero section, our café’s name, and a few highlighted drinks.  
I aimed for a warm and cozy vibe so people feel like they’re about to walk into the store.

# Store Locations Page
Shows three Shake & Sip outlets arranged in a neat card layout.  
Each card is clickable thanks to JavaScript, so it pops out a little when you press it.  
Just a small touch, but it makes the page feel more alive!

# Menu Page
A simple menu display with our full drinks image.  
This page is mainly visual, so it stays clean and focused.

# Styling Choices
All styling is in separate CSS files to keep things organised.  
I used neutral tones like beige and brown (like coffee!) so the theme feels warm and bakery-like.  
Also, every page uses the same navigation bar to keep consistency across the whole website.

# JavaScript Interactivity
I added a few small interactions because the project requires JavaScript, but I also made sure not to overdo it:

* Navbar hover effect**  
  Each link changes color when you hover over it, making the navigation feel more responsive.
* Clickable location cards**  
  On the Store Locations page, clicking a store card makes it slightly “pop” using a CSS class toggle.  
  It just adds a bit of personality to the otherwise static cards.

These features are simple, but they make the site feel more polished and interactive.

# Final Thoughts
Honestly, this project was pretty fun to build.  
I got to experiment with layouts, colours, and some small JavaScript interactions that make the site feel more alive.  
I hope you enjoy browsing through it as much as I enjoyed putting it together! 😄

If you spot anything I can improve, I’m always open to feedback!
